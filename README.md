## **Technical Aspects**  
💻 **Technologies Used**:  
✅ **Power BI** – For building interactive reports.  
✅ **DAX Measures** – Used for advanced calculations, including:  
   ```DAX
   Delay Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Total Delayed Flights], [Total Arrived Flights], 0) * 100
   ```
   ```DAX
   On-Time Rate (%) = 100 - [Delay Rate (%)]
   ```
✅ **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleanup.  
✅ **ZoomCharts Drill Down Visuals** – For advanced **drill-through analysis**.
